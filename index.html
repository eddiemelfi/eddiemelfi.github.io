<h1>Welcome to Edmond’s Programming Portfolio</h1>
      </h1>

My name is <strong>Edmond Melfi</strong> but you can call me Eddie.  <br> This is a website I made during my CSC 106: Joy of Programming class during my time at the University of Rhode Island. <br> This website will showcase all the working programs that I wrote.
I started CSC 106 on January 23, 2023 and this is my first ever coding class. I have never thought about or touched a line of code until that day. For our final project, we have to make an app that is downloadable on any smart devices. So stay tuned for that lol
